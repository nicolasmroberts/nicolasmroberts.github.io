                    I am a structural geologist and Assistant Professor of Geosciences at Hamilton College. My research is motivated by trying to understand the rheological evolution of deforming parts of Earth's continental crust. Some of my current projects focus on shear zone evolution from a strain, strain-rate, and stress perspective; deep crustal flow in the Archean, and magma and fault system interractions. My main analytical approaches include field data collection and mapping, electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD), anisotropy of magnetic susceptibility (AMS), and statistical analysis of structural data. My lab at Hamilton that is equipped with an AGICO KLY5S Anisotropy of Magnetic Susceptibility Kappabridge and the equipment to prepare AMS samples. 

            </p>

            <p class = "centeredParagraphWhite">
                   Working closely with undergraduate students is one of my great professional joys. We have travelled to Western Australia, Arizona, and Maine to conduct fieldwork, and have spent countless hours processing samples, collecting EBSD data, and thinking through interesting scientific puzzels.
            </p>

            <p class = "centeredParagraphWhite">
                    I have taugh a wide variety of courses at Hamilton, including an introductory Geosciences course, Structural Geology and Tectonics, Geophysics, and a field course in Arizona. I care deeply about teaching. Geologic processes exert an enormous control on many of today's pressing issues, from climate change to water resources to energy. Whether or not students persue a career in the geosciences, we need to increase our society's geologic literacy. Take a look at my teaching page to hear more about my teaching philosophy.
            </p>

            <p class = "centeredParagraphWhite">
                       In all aspects of my professional life, I am committed to the enduringly important work of broadening participation in and increasing the diversity, equity, and inclusion of the geosciences.
