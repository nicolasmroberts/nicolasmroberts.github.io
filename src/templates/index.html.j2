            <h2>Welcome</h2>
            <p>
                    I am a fifth year PhD student in the Structure and Tectonics group at the University of  Wisconsin-Madison with <a href="http://geoscience.wisc.edu/geoscience/people/faculty/basil-tikoff/">Basil Tikoff</a>. My research interests include <strong> early Earth crustal processes, microstructural shear zone kinematics, pluton and dome emplacement, and statistical analysis of structural geology data </strong>. For my PhD, I am applying  all these interests to investigate the kinematic and emplacement history of several Paleoarchean granitic complexes of the 3.5-3.2 Ga East Pilbara craton, Western Australia.
            </p>

            <p>
          
                    As part of the East Pilbara project, I am working with two undergraduate Geoscience majors from UW Madison. We just came back from a productive field season of mapping a few large scale folds in the Warrawoona greenstone belt and conducting an anisotropy of magnetic suceptibility sampling campaign in the Mt Edgar granitic complex.
            </p>

            <p>
                    I am regularly adding to this website (it's new and still under construction), so come back often.
