        <h2> About me </h2>
        <p>
                I am a PhD student at <em> The University of Wisconsin-Madison</em>, working with <a href="http://geoscience.wisc.edu/geoscience/people/faculty/basil-tikoff/"> Basil Tikoff</a>.     I've spent most of my PhD working on an Archean granitic complex in the Pilbara Craton, Western Australia: the Mt Edgar granitic complex. The geodynamics that drove the construction and deformation of earth's Earliest continents (the Pilbara craton has rocks as old as 3.6 billion years old) is a matter of ongoing debate--was plate tectonics already operating at a global scale, or did these early continents form in some pre-plate tectonics context?
        </p>
        <p>
                I also work on the statistical treatment of high-dimensional structural geology data (like foliation-lineation pairs, strain ellipsoids), primarily with <a href = "http://joshuadavis.us">Joshua Davis</a> at Carleton College. The advent of methods and tools for analyzing structural geology data statistically nicely coincides with a trend towards larger datasets, especially as new databases come online.
