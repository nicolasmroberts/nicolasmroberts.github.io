<h2>Statistical analysis scripts </h2>
	<p>This page contains scripts I use for statistical (and visual) analysis of structural geology data. I have worked with many types of geologic data, including field fabrics, anisotropy of magnetic susceptibility ellipsoids, and X-ray computed tomography grain ellipsoid data.</p>
      <p> For published work, I include all the files necessary to reproduce my statistical analysis.</p>

      <div class= "contentContainer">
            <h4>From <em>The utility of statistical analysis in structural geology</em> (Roberts et al., 2018)</h4>
            <p>Download the <a href="Robertsetal_Manuscript.pdf">manuscript</a> and the <a href="Robertsetal_Figures.pdf">figures</a>.</p>
            <p>This paper analyzes three datasets: two from the West Mountain area of the western Idaho shear zone, and one from the Orofino area of the western Idaho shear zone, locally the Ahsahka shear zone. The two datasets from West Mountain are a foliation dataset and a dataset of foliation-lineation pairs. The data from Orofino are foliation-lineation pairs.</p>

            <ol>

            	<li>
                        Dowload <a href = "geologyGeometry.zip"><em>geologyGeometry</em> June 2017 version</a>. <strong> Note:</strong>to download the most recent version of geologyGeometry (which may not be compatible with this statistical analysis), visit <a href="http://www.joshuadavis.us/software">Joshua Davis's website</a>
                  </li>
            	
                  <li>
                        Drag the <em>geologyGeometry.zip</em> folder to your desktop.
                  </li>
                  
                  <li>
                        Inside the <em>geologyGeometry</em> folder, you will find a <em>readme.rft</em> file. Follow the setup instructions in this file to download R, RStudio, and the necessary R packages.
                  </li>
            	
                  <li>
                        open <em>JSG_StatisticalAnalysis_Orofino.r, JSG_statisticalAnalysis_WestMountain.r, </em>and <em> JSG_statsFunctions_direction.R</em>, also in the <em>geologyGeometry</em> folder, in RStudio.
                  </li>
                  
                  <li>
                        Each of these files is a different statistical analysis. At the top of each one, change <span style="font-family:courier new;color:#050">setwd('~Desktop/20170620geologyGeometry')</span> to reflect the true path to your <em>geologyGeometry</em> folder. 
                  </li>

                  <li>
                        Run each file line by line. Enjoy! 
                  </li>
