	<h2>Teaching Geology</h2>
	<p> 
		Teaching geology at the undergraduate level has been an integral part of my graduate school experience. I have TAed Structural Geology (3 times) and Mineralogy at UW-Madison. In 2016, I was an instructor on a 10 Week field program in New Zealand run by Carleton College. Most recently, I was a visiting instructor for Structural Geology at Colorado College. Teaching has been a source of inspiration for me and has energizing my research.
